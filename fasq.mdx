## Basic Platform Questions

**Q: Is this a real assessment platform or some kind of elaborate prank?**
A: Yes, it's a real platform. No, it's not a prank. Though after taking the assessment, you might wish it were.

**Q: Why can't I just submit my GitHub profile instead?**
A: Because your GitHub profile doesn't show us how you handle a midlife crisis sports car algorithm or debug quantum coffee machines.

**Q: Do I need to know all 168 programming languages?**
A: Only if you want to suffer in maximum variety. Pick one and commit to your doom.

**Q: What if I've never coded before but I have a computer science degree?**
A: Perfect! You're exactly who we're looking for. Theoretical knowledge meets practical chaos.

**Q: Can I use Stack Overflow during the assessment?**
A: Sure, go ahead and search for "how to manage dinosaur emotions in reverse gravity." Let us know how that works out.

**Q: Is there a practice mode?**
A: Life is practice mode. This is the real thing.

**Q: Why are the questions so weird?**
A: Because debugging a missing semicolon for 6 hours isn't weird at all, right?

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**
A: Only if your partner is a rubber duck. They're surprisingly good at this.

**Q: How long should each answer be?**
A: Shorter is better. Novel-length explanations suggest you don't understand the problem.

**Q: What if I don't finish all three questions?**
A: Then you'll have successfully demonstrated project management skills - knowing when to quit.

## Technical Questions

**Q: Which IDE should I use?**
A: The one that won't judge you for your variable names. Spoiler: they all will.

**Q: Can I use AI to help me?**
A: Go ahead. Watch ChatGPT have an existential crisis trying to interpret our questions.

**Q: Do you support mobile development?**
A: We support emotional development. Mobile is just bonus points.

**Q: What about frameworks?**
A: React, Vue, Angular, jQuery - they're all just fancy ways to hide your JavaScript shame.

**Q: Is functional programming better than object-oriented?**
A: Both are equally capable of making you question your career choices.

**Q: Should I comment my code?**
A: Only if you want future you to understand what current you was thinking. Hint: you won't.

**Q: What's the difference between = and ==?**
A: About 3 hours of debugging and one nervous breakdown.

**Q: How do I handle edge cases?**
A: The same way you handle regular cases, but with more crying.

**Q: What if my code doesn't compile?**
A: Welcome to software development. Population: everyone.

**Q: Should I optimize for performance?**
A: Optimize for your sanity first. Performance is just a nice-to-have.

## Assessment Process

**Q: When do I get my results?**
A: When three AI personalities finish roasting your code. Usually within minutes.

**Q: Can I retake the assessment?**
A: Depends on how masochistic your potential employer is feeling.

**Q: What if I panic during the assessment?**
A: That's not a bug, it's a feature. Panic is how we measure authentic developer experience.

**Q: Can I pause the assessment?**
A: Yes, but the existential dread doesn't pause with it.

**Q: What if I submit accidentally?**
A: Then you've successfully simulated the experience of pushing to production on Friday afternoon.

**Q: Do I need to dress up for this?**
A: It's a coding assessment, not a wedding. Pajamas are encouraged.

**Q: Can I take this assessment while drunk?**
A: We can't stop you, but the AI reviewers might be able to tell.

**Q: What if I have a brilliant insight at 3 AM?**
A: Write it down. Most 3 AM insights are just sleep-deprived hallucinations.

**Q: Should I explain my thought process?**
A: Only if you can explain it to yourself first.

**Q: What if I hate all the questions?**
A: Then you're in the right place. Self-loathing is a core developer skill.

## Company Questions

**Q: Why do you charge $39 per assessment?**
A: Because traumatizing candidates with quality entertainment costs money.

**Q: Can we customize the questions?**
A: No, but you can customize your expectations. Lower them significantly.

**Q: How do we integrate this with our ATS?**
A: Webhooks. If your ATS doesn't support webhooks, get a new ATS.

**Q: What if a candidate complains about the difficulty?**
A: Show them the door. You don't want someone who can't handle fictional chaos managing real systems.

**Q: Can we see the questions before sending to candidates?**
A: You can browse them, but knowing what's coming won't help. Nothing can prepare you.

**Q: How do we know if someone cheated?**
A: Trust us, if they could cheat on these questions, we'd hire them ourselves.

**Q: What's your refund policy?**
A: All sales are final, like regret and technical debt.

**Q: Do you offer enterprise pricing?**
A: Enterprise pricing is for enterprises that need enterprise features. You need simpler features.

**Q: Can we white-label this?**
A: Why would you want to take credit for this beautiful chaos?

**Q: How do we explain this to our legal department?**
A: Very carefully, with lawyers present and liability insurance ready.

A: Seek professional help. Or consider a career in dev rel.

**Q: Will this make me a better programmer?**
A: It will make you a more confused programmer. Close enough.

A: Algorithms won't help you here. Therapy might.

**Q: What if I discover I actually hate programming?**
A: Welcome to the club. Meetings are every day at your keyboard.

**Q: Is it normal to cry during technical assessments?**
A: Crying is just debugging for emotions.

## Random Technical Philosophy
