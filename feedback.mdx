## Bug Reports

If something is actually broken (not just confusing), email us at `support@errorgolf.com` with:

- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead  
- Any error messages (screenshots are fine, we're not monsters)

"It doesn't work" is not a bug report. "Webhook returns 500 when payload contains special characters" is a bug report.

## Feature Requests

We built this because existing platforms suck. If you want the same features they have, just use them.

That said, if you have a genuinely good idea that fits our "test creativity, not memorization" philosophy, we might listen.

## API Questions

Read the docs first. Seriously. The answer to "How do I validate a company code?" is literally on the API reference page.

If you've actually read the documentation and still have questions, that's either:
1. A documentation bug (our fault)
2. An edge case we didn't think of (also our fault)
3. You're trying to do something weird (probably your fault, but we're curious)

## Integration Help

**Before you email us:**
- Did you test your webhook with our test button?
- Are you verifying our HMAC signature correctly?
- Are you handling both test and live payloads properly?
- Did you check your server logs for actual error messages?

**Common issues we're tired of debugging:**
- Your firewall is blocking our webhooks
- You're expecting form data instead of JSON
- Your webhook secret has extra whitespace
- You're returning 200 for internal errors

## Philosophy Complaints

If you think our questions are "too weird" or "not realistic," you've missed the point entirely. 

Traditional tests measure how well someone memorized algorithms. Our tests measure how someone thinks when the requirements make no sense - which is basically every real software project.

If you want FizzBuzz implementations, there are plenty of other platforms that will happily charge you $500/month for the privilege.

## Billing Questions

You pay $49 once, then $39 every time someone submits an assessment. This is not complicated.

If Stripe declined your card, that's between you and Stripe. We're not customer service for your bank.

## Response Times

We'll respond to actual technical issues within 24 hours (usually much faster).

We won't respond to:
- "Can you add support for my obscure ATS?"
- "Why don't you have more traditional programming questions?"
- "Can you make this work like [insert competitor name]?"

## The Nuclear Option

If our platform fundamentally doesn't work for your hiring process, just use something else. We're not trying to be everything to everyone.

We built this for companies that want to find creative problem-solvers, not companies that want to test sorting algorithms.

## Contact Info

**Technical Issues:** `support@errorgolf.com`

**Everything Else:** Read the docs again, then maybe don't email us.

**Sales Questions:** There's no sales team, and you hate them anyway. You pay $49, you get a company code. We're super friendly when you have a problem.
